[07:29:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> I just turned the big boiler back on
[07:29:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> we are not making enough creosote
[07:30:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <flfloflflo> we need oil !
[07:30:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> yeah I'm working on that
[07:32:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <flfloflflo> we could pump oil directly in the boiler
[07:32:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> or we could make light fuel
[07:33:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <flfloflflo> that's a few steps away
[07:33:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> oh is it?
[07:33:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <flfloflflo> we need a dedicated distillery, chemical reactor and electrolyzer
[07:34:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> we got all of that, tho we want a second chem reactor and electrolyzer
[07:34:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <flfloflflo> yup, because they are going to be running 24/7
[07:34:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <flfloflflo> also, combustion generator
[07:34:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> I made one
[07:35:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <flfloflflo> so we can already pump
[07:35:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> yeah
[07:37:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <flfloflflo> I see
[07:37:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <flfloflflo> you want to distillate on the spot
[07:37:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> yeah I think that's best
