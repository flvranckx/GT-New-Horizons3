[10:55:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> we have 4
[10:55:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> I just macerated some

[10:57:59] [Server thread/INFO]: _0x40_, Princess_Kat12
[10:58:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> just put ingots in it to make plates
[10:58:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> and you can change the circuit to make other stuff
[10:58:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> o dear this makes nuggets not igots
[10:59:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> how do i turn this to ingots then
[10:59:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> you can use the alloy furnace
[10:59:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> should be a chest next to it with an ingot cast
[11:00:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> i see
[11:00:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> alright
[11:00:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> if i want to make double plates do i just send them back through?
[11:00:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> we pumpin creosote into the boiler now
[11:01:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> yeah I think so?
[11:01:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> guess we find out
[11:01:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> gotta change the circuit to 2
[11:01:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> ah it just turns it into foil
[11:01:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> shit
[11:01:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> o well
[11:02:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> oh
[11:02:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> actually it can't make double plates until mv
[11:02:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> guess ill just slam it with a hammer
[11:03:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> yeah make the regular plates with the bender then hammer to make double
[11:03:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> im sure that foil will be useful for somthing maybe
[11:05:17] [Server thread/INFO] [Morpheus]: _0x40_ is now sleeping. 1/2 (50%)
[11:05:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> i think this is going to be very expensive in the gold
[11:05:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> if you wanted to save time you could hammer the crushed gold and then smelt that directly into ingot
[11:05:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> tho it's slightly less efficient
[11:06:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> nah this is fine i simply just dont think we have enough gold
[11:06:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> I'll go mine more then
[11:06:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> as it takes 4 double plates for 1 gold chest
[11:06:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> yeah so 8 ingots per chest

[13:59:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> 90% sure i didnt need it as the ui tells me
[14:00:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> so do i just want to keep swapping it for higher tier stuff?
[14:00:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <JustDiving> More like expanding\
[14:00:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <JustDiving> Breeding everything with everything

[14:01:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <Scardalf> Lv starting well

[14:03:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <Scardalf> we can now have a lot of machine
[14:03:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> this plant poops rubber
[14:03:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <JustDiving> Cool
[14:03:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <Scardalf> never exessive in GT XD
[14:03:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <JustDiving> Good job
[14:03:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> I think we wanna move it so we can have machines on all 4 sides of the cable
[14:03:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> was that the thing i needed?
[14:03:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <JustDiving> Think so
[14:03:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <Scardalf> yes we will do that
[14:03:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> lol
[14:03:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> since it's lossy we want as short cable as possible
[14:03:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> well that was the only one we hd
[14:04:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> when we get the electric blast furnace we get lossless lv cable
