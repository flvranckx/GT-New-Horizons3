[06:51:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> alrighty
[06:52:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> plan was currently to make it a 3*3 flat tank on top and build up maybe but i also dont know how the
[06:52:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> water or steam connects
[06:53:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> just realised i made a bunch iron plates i didnt need
[06:53:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> noice
[06:53:31] [Server thread/INFO] [YAMCL]: Creating backup of currently working storage file...
[06:53:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> i think probably just creasote blocks down here machines the floor above once i make the floor
[06:54:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> yeah sounds good
[06:55:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> floor maybe 5 high so the steel multiblock ccan be down here too
[06:55:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> yea
[06:55:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> annd then maybe when we can replace it with the one that can take creasote so we can use that up too
[06:58:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> but as you have got further i go to your knowledge
[06:58:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> no it sounds good
[06:58:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> we maybe want 2 boilers one solid one liquid?
[06:59:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> in lv we need lots of steam
[06:59:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> dont see why not but i we might need a better tank
[06:59:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> water tank i mean
[06:59:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> yeah we'll need 2 or 3 probably
[07:00:41] [Server thread/INFO] [Morpheus]: _0x40_ is now sleeping. 1/2 (50%)
[07:00:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> they are easy to make they just take up a lot of space
[07:01:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> well i guess roof watertanks
[07:01:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> yeah
[07:01:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> you think if we do that with the liquid one next it in the same form?
[07:01:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> like 3*3 tank and up
[07:01:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> yeah it should work
[07:02:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> how many creasote things?
[07:02:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> coke ovens i mena
[07:02:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> appart from all of them
[07:02:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> 4 maybe for now?
[07:02:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> im guessing more is always better
[07:03:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> I think that keeps up with a 3x3 liquid boiler

[07:59:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> so I think next step is more coke ovens
[07:59:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> yeah probably
[08:00:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> and we need tinkers axe so we can get logs easier
[08:00:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> and for that we need a lot of iron
[08:00:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> yeah but we need the better table first
[08:01:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> that seems a better use of space
[08:01:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> i do have almost all the parts i need for the steel oven
[08:02:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> ah good do you wanna work on that and I'll do the tinker table?
[08:02:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> yeah you will need to make alumite tho
