[22:42:37] [Server thread/INFO]: flfloflflo joined the game
[22:42:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> hello!
[22:42:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> we're in mv now
[22:43:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <flfloflflo> I excpeted no less of you
[22:43:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <flfloflflo> how did you do about the gallium arsenic challenge ?
[22:44:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> I just used cobalt
[22:44:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> from twilight forest
[22:44:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <flfloflflo> hum?
[22:44:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <flfloflflo> didn't know about that
[22:46:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <flfloflflo> and where is the mv line ?
[22:46:31] [Server thread/INFO]: There are 2/20 players online:
[22:46:31] [Server thread/INFO]: _0x40_, flfloflflo
[22:47:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> I'm waiting for aluminium rn for an mv combustion gen
[22:47:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <flfloflflo> so we can replace the 4 lv ?
[22:47:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <flfloflflo> or to build a new line
[22:48:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <flfloflflo> because this was stupid but the only way
[22:48:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <flfloflflo> hooo, you changed the cables
[22:49:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <flfloflflo> you know that I have disabled the explosion of machine in the rain ?
[22:49:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> I planned on powering just the mv electrolyzer with it, since that's the only mv machine I got
[22:49:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> oh
[22:50:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <flfloflflo> The only reason is that I don't want a whole line of machine to blow up for no reason
[22:50:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <flfloflflo> since most of the people on the server are newbie
[22:50:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> yeah that's resonable I guess
[22:50:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <flfloflflo> and other pack like nomi have it disabled by default
[22:51:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <flfloflflo> also, overvolting destroy the machine but don't make it explode
[22:51:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <flfloflflo> did the server stop at 8 pm ?
[22:52:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> yeah it did
[22:52:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <flfloflflo> from behing empty ?
[22:52:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <flfloflflo> or aws?
[22:52:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> no it just stopped while I was on
[22:52:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <flfloflflo> you got the 'server closed' message ?
[22:52:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> yeah probably aws
[22:53:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <flfloflflo> so my code is working ...
[22:53:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> nice
[22:53:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <flfloflflo> I don't know what happened on the first day
[22:53:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <flfloflflo> I didn't change the spot watcher
[22:54:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <flfloflflo> I'm going to change the instance size. Reducing the cpu from 4 to 2
[22:54:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> ah alright
[22:54:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <flfloflflo> It's very smooth, I want to see if cheaper is fine to
[22:54:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <flfloflflo> oo
[22:55:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <flfloflflo> I suppose you didn't see any performance issue ?
[22:55:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> no not really
[22:55:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <flfloflflo> alright, I'm going to try then
[22:55:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <flfloflflo> see if 2 cpu is enough
[22:56:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <flfloflflo> also, we need more disk space ^^

[23:01:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> alright
[23:05:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <flfloflflo> you mind if we restart to two cpu now ?
