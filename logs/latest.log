[10:35:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> we got a bending machine now
[10:35:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> so 1 ingot = 1 plate
[10:35:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> thats very nice

[10:40:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> yeah me neither
[10:41:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> pretty overwelmed
[10:41:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> tbh
[10:41:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> do you wanna help make some lv machines?
[10:42:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> can do but what i think i might do first is re arange some of the horrific storage we have so we can
[10:42:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> find things
[10:42:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> yeah that would be nice
[10:42:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> it's a pain having to move between different floors to find stuff
[10:42:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> i think most of it will end upstairs tbh just big machines down here
[10:43:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> whoes bed is just out there
[10:43:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> oh that's probably mine
[10:44:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> this is probably gonna get worse till it gets better btw
[10:44:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> whilst i move things
[10:44:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> yeah that's fine
[10:45:29] [Server thread/INFO]: _0x40_ has just earned the achievement [Pump]

[10:48:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> yup

[10:54:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> i think the best plan i have rn is upgrade every chest to iron chests
[10:54:08] [Thread-32/INFO]: Backup finished.
[10:54:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> that should help greatly
[10:54:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> yeah or gold chests
[10:54:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> think i have to iron then gold sadly
[10:54:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> o wait no i dont
[10:54:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> do we have a lot of gold?
[10:55:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> no
[10:55:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> we have 4
[10:55:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> I just macerated some
[10:55:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> here
[10:57:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> so how does the bending machine work
[10:57:59] [Server thread/INFO]: There are 2/20 players online:
[10:57:59] [Server thread/INFO]: _0x40_, Princess_Kat12
[10:58:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> just put ingots in it to make plates
[10:58:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> and you can change the circuit to make other stuff
[10:58:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> o dear this makes nuggets not igots
[10:59:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> how do i turn this to ingots then
[10:59:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> you can use the alloy furnace
[10:59:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> should be a chest next to it with an ingot cast
[11:00:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> i see
[11:00:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> alright
[11:00:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> if i want to make double plates do i just send them back through?
[11:00:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> we pumpin creosote into the boiler now
[11:01:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> yeah I think so?
[11:01:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> guess we find out
[11:01:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> gotta change the circuit to 2
[11:01:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> ah it just turns it into foil
[11:01:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> shit
[11:01:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> o well
[11:02:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> oh
[11:02:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> actually it can't make double plates until mv
[11:02:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> guess ill just slam it with a hammer
[11:03:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> yeah make the regular plates with the bender then hammer to make double
[11:03:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> im sure that foil will be useful for somthing maybe
[11:05:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> i think this is going to be very expensive in the gold
[11:05:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> if you wanted to save time you could hammer the crushed gold and then smelt that directly into ingot
[11:05:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> tho it's slightly less efficient
[11:06:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> nah this is fine i simply just dont think we have enough gold
[11:06:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> I'll go mine more then
[11:06:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> as it takes 4 double plates for 1 gold chest
[11:06:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> yeah so 8 ingots per chest
[11:07:59] [Server thread/INFO]: There are 2/20 players online:
[11:07:59] [Server thread/INFO]: _0x40_, Princess_Kat12
[11:09:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> have we got a less terrible ways to make screws yet?
[11:09:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> soon
[11:10:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> just need to make a lathe

[11:10:25] [Thread-34/INFO]: Worlds saved.

[11:10:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> as it needs screws also
[11:10:51] [Thread-34/INFO]: Backup finished.
[11:11:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> do you wanna make a lathe then?
[11:11:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> it helps with both rods and screws
[11:11:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> yes i will
[11:18:00] [Server thread/INFO]: There are 2/20 players online:
[11:18:00] [Server thread/INFO]: _0x40_, Princess_Kat12

[11:34:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> yeah you can turn them off if it becomes a problem
[11:34:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> with wooden hammer
[11:36:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> all the gregtech machines can be toggled on and off with a soft mallet
[11:36:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> ah okay thats helpful
[11:36:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> yeah it's useful if a machine runs out of power
[11:37:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> some of these things are just so random im not even sure how to sort them
[11:38:00] [Server thread/INFO]: There are 2/20 players online:
[11:38:00] [Server thread/INFO]: _0x40_, Princess_Kat12
[11:38:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> I think it's fine to dedicate a couple chests for misc. junk
[11:38:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> instead of trying to sort everything
[11:43:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> my axe should be somewhere if you need it

[14:00:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <JustDiving> More like expanding\
[14:00:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <JustDiving> Breeding everything with everything
[14:01:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <JustDiving> And saving new thing somewhere else

[14:03:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <JustDiving> Good job
[14:03:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> I think we wanna move it so we can have machines on all 4 sides of the cable
[14:03:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> was that the thing i needed?
[14:03:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <JustDiving> Think so
[14:03:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <Scardalf> yes we will do that
[14:03:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> lol
[14:03:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> since it's lossy we want as short cable as possible
[14:03:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> well that was the only one we hd
[14:04:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> when we get the electric blast furnace we get lossless lv cable

[15:48:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> there was liquind ender in there but I guess an enderman must have teleported into it
[15:48:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <flfloflflo> very rare
[15:48:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> if you want the plant stuff is in there
[15:48:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <flfloflflo> your crops look wonderful
[15:48:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> it is very pretty
[15:49:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> tis the kitchen/garden shed

[15:50:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> a mob farm i believe that dosnt work or does i dunno
[15:50:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <flfloflflo> well
[15:50:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <flfloflflo> for mobs it is easy
[15:50:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <flfloflflo> find a dungeon and isolate a spawner
[15:50:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <flfloflflo> at level 3 of dungeons, you might find an enderman spawner
[15:51:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> I guess we could build a smeltery under the spawner
[15:51:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <flfloflflo> kind of rare but once you find it, it's free ender pearls
[15:51:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> if we can't find one with regen
[15:52:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <flfloflflo> once we have nether stars, we can move a spawner with a diamond dolly
[15:53:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> my son
