[06:43:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> yeah true
[06:44:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> its 40 seconds a block btw
[06:44:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> yeah
[06:45:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> speed not available
[06:46:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> i love losing shit

[06:47:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> yup
[06:48:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> noice
[06:48:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> just made one
[06:49:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> just put it on the middle for now
[06:49:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> do we want the machines here?
[06:49:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> i do however not know how this works
[06:49:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> o it did form
[06:49:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> col
[06:49:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> we gotta supply water from the tank
[06:49:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> yeah i was planning to make big tubes to bring it from the roof down here
[06:50:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> we need tubes in both direction then, for water and steam
[06:50:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> yeah wood tubes for cold water bronze for steam i guess
[06:50:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> yeah

[06:51:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> I'll do the water pipes
[06:51:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> alrighty
[06:52:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> plan was currently to make it a 3*3 flat tank on top and build up maybe but i also dont know how the
[06:52:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> water or steam connects
[06:53:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> just realised i made a bunch iron plates i didnt need
[06:53:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> noice
[06:53:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> i think probably just creasote blocks down here machines the floor above once i make the floor
[06:54:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> yeah sounds good
[06:55:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> floor maybe 5 high so the steel multiblock ccan be down here too
[06:55:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> yea
[06:55:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> annd then maybe when we can replace it with the one that can take creasote so we can use that up too
[06:58:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> but as you have got further i go to your knowledge
[06:58:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> no it sounds good
[06:58:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> we maybe want 2 boilers one solid one liquid?
[06:59:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> in lv we need lots of steam
[06:59:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> dont see why not but i we might need a better tank
[06:59:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> water tank i mean
[06:59:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> yeah we'll need 2 or 3 probably
[07:00:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> they are easy to make they just take up a lot of space
[07:01:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> well i guess roof watertanks
[07:01:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> yeah
[07:01:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> you think if we do that with the liquid one next it in the same form?
[07:01:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> like 3*3 tank and up
[07:01:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> yeah it should work
[07:02:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> how many creasote things?
[07:02:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> coke ovens i mena
[07:02:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> appart from all of them
[07:02:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> 4 maybe for now?
[07:02:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> im guessing more is always better
[07:03:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> I think that keeps up with a 3x3 liquid boiler

[07:10:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> there is 2 more small pipes
[07:10:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> yeah we need the regular sized tho for 2 3x3 boilers
[07:11:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> well as we only have 1 tank rn
[07:11:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> yeah could upgrade later
[07:11:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> just a connection would be nice
[07:15:22] [Server thread/INFO]: _0x40_ has just earned the achievement [Bronze]
[07:18:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> for now should i build the 5 second floor so we can not have to make as much bronze pipe?
[07:18:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> 5 high second floor
[07:19:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> sure

[07:21:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> will anything we have rn have a problem with rain if i remove the roof for a bit?
[07:21:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> I don't think so
[07:21:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> it's just electric stuff that's a problem
[07:21:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> okay as ive heard some stuff does guess we just dont have it yet
[07:22:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> can you wrench the pipes?

[07:28:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> is that slightly less terrible?
[07:28:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> yeah seems good
[07:29:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> guess now we have to make sure we dont run out of water
[07:29:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> yeah true
[07:29:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> it will explode if it runs out
[07:29:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> well that would be a spectacular start to steam
[07:29:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> haha
[07:31:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> i had grand plans to make steel today but it seems like im just rebuilding walls today

[07:44:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> true
[07:45:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> but once this is moved and the chests are moved space will be more usuable
[07:45:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> yeah it's good for a starter base I think
[07:45:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> it's better than mine was
[07:46:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> i had a cave
[07:46:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> so
[07:46:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> same
[07:47:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> sorry
[07:47:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> haha that scared me
[07:47:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> no worries
[07:47:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> move those when you want i just put them there so they were out the way
[07:49:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> there is 2 more pipes
[07:49:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> i keep finding them

[07:51:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> yeah seems like it
[07:51:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> noice so this was worth the effort then
[07:51:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> prepare for a rain of items possibly
[07:53:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> should i move the stairs do you think?
[07:53:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> maybe too a side

[07:58:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> seems like it can't keep up with 3 machines
[07:58:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> well thats a shame
[07:59:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> still less terrible than the normal boiler
[07:59:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> with 2x2 it will keep up but it will eat a lot of charcoal
[07:59:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> so I think next step is more coke ovens
[07:59:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> yeah probably
[08:00:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> and we need tinkers axe so we can get logs easier
[08:00:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> and for that we need a lot of iron
[08:00:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> yeah but we need the better table first
[08:01:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> that seems a better use of space
[08:01:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> i do have almost all the parts i need for the steel oven
[08:02:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> ah good do you wanna work on that and I'll do the tinker table?
[08:02:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> yeah you will need to make alumite tho
