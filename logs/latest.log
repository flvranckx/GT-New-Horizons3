[10:58:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> i already have enough clay to get rid of that instantly
[11:00:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> guess what
[11:00:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> youve ran out of sand
[11:00:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> pranked
[11:00:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> wow
[11:00:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> yeah i had a lot of clay
[11:00:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> and i still have a lot of clay
[11:02:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> once they are cooked and combined i should 128 coke oven bricks
[11:03:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> coke oven blocks
[11:03:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> nice, that's a lot of coke ovens
[11:03:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> so that should make enough of those for a while
[11:03:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> but i will need a the big axe to keep those filled

[11:06:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> yup that's why we want 4
[11:08:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> alright one machine down
[11:08:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> building already isnt big enough
[11:08:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> sadge
[11:09:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> i think what might worth doing once the big tool is made is go find some really tall trees
[11:10:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> didn't we plant one of those big tree saplings somewhere?
[11:10:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> no clue

[11:33:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> im digging a hill

[11:35:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> is there atleast enough stuff to make me a better shovel?
[11:35:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> I guess you can make one out of bronze or iron?
[11:35:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> it won't have much durability tho
[11:35:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> yeah thats true
[11:36:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> think the axe is the priority
[11:36:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> really
[11:37:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> i really didnt think that floor would fill that fast
[11:38:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> maybe it's better to stack the coke ovens vertically?
[11:38:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> ive no idea i know if they touch they dont work
[11:39:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> and if 3 are upstairs it would be a pain to fill
[11:41:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> when we get item pipes that won't be a problem
[11:41:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> just one input chest and one output chest
[11:42:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> pretty sure we can already make those pipes

[11:53:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> yeah alright
[11:53:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> i just suddenly thought about it
[11:54:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> can't we just put them in the floor?
[11:54:46] [Server thread/INFO]: There are 2/20 players online:
[11:54:46] [Server thread/INFO]: _0x40_, Princess_Kat12
[11:54:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> what?
[11:55:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> so that the top of the coke oven is the floor
[11:55:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> yeah i suppose we could yeah
[11:55:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> so it would look like this
[11:55:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> can't tell if it's on tho
[11:56:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> yeah thats a lil problem atic
[11:56:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> but it would probably work
[11:56:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> I guess you could put glass so you can see if it's on
[11:57:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> still would need to empty them tho

[13:14:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> so ox how to i pipe wood in and charcoal out
[13:14:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> hm, I think the only way right now is with hoppers
[13:14:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> that sounds like a pain
[13:14:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> in lv we get item pipes
[13:14:46] [Server thread/INFO]: There are 2/20 players online:
[13:14:46] [Server thread/INFO]: _0x40_, Princess_Kat12
[13:14:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> we already have access to them im pretty sure
[13:15:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> I don't think we can use them without lv components
[13:15:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> I think you need conveyor belts to extract items into the pipe
[13:15:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> tin pipes
[13:15:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> i think
[13:16:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> maybe it's possible with hoppers and pipes?
[13:16:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> i just got a slime tree sapling
[13:16:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> oh nice
[13:16:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> slime is good for tinekers tool rods I've heard
[13:16:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> they are
[13:17:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> but what i think needs doing is some more farming
[13:17:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> yeah
[13:17:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> as we are running very low on food again
[13:19:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> alright time for some industrial grade farming
[13:20:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> you think should farm large style on the other side of the river?
[13:20:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> like behind the tinkers thing
[13:20:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> yeah that sounds good
[13:20:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> as its seems the factory is going to ever grow on that side
