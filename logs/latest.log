[02:43:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> and we are in lv now technically
[02:43:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> what does pollution even do
[02:43:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> destroys the environment
[02:43:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> like it replaces random blocks
[02:43:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> do we really need it
[02:43:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> and it gives you debuffs like poison randomly
[02:44:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> thats not ideal
[02:44:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> yeah I moved it to the mountain
[02:44:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <Princess_Kat12> o is that the thing above the farm
[02:44:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <_0x40_> I'll move it back when the pollution goes away
